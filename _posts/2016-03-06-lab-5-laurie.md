I chose a short story to do my diagram on&#8211;Eudora Welty&#8217;s &#8220;Why I Live at the P.O&#8221;.  There were four main characters and then a fifth and six (which became very vocal later). I separated the nodes by number and then by gender attributes.  1 for female, 2 for male.  My edges quickly multiplied and I found myself going over connections that I had already made.  Needless to say, the females did the majority of the talking, which for a southern story seemed very appropriate.  (:  Sister is the main character, so her node had the most interaction between all the other nodes.  For those of you unfamiliar with Eudora Welty, she&#8217;s fabulous.  Check her out.
